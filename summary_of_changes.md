# Summary of Changes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Role-Based Access Control for Client Users

In the file `/workspace/backenddjango/applications/views.py`, we implemented proper filtering for client users:

- **Problem**: The ApplicationViewSet didn't filter applications for client users, allowing them to potentially see applications they shouldn't have access to.
- **Solution**: Implemented a `get_queryset` method in the ApplicationViewSet that filters applications for client users to only show applications they're associated with as borrowers.

```python
def get_queryset(self):
    """
    Filter applications based on user role:
    - Admin, BD, Broker: All applications
    - Client: Only applications they're associated with
    """
    queryset = Application.objects.all().order_by('-created_at')
    
    # If user is a client, only show applications they're associated with
    if self.request.user.role == 'client':
        from borrowers.models import Borrower
        borrower = Borrower.objects.filter(user=self.request.user).first()
        if borrower:
            return queryset.filter(borrowers=borrower)
        return Application.objects.none()
    
    return queryset
```

### 2. Enhanced Role-Based Access Control Tests

In the file `/workspace/backenddjango/tests/integration/test_api_connections.py`, we enhanced the role-based access control tests:

- **Problem**: The test didn't verify that client users could only see applications they're associated with.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `test_role_based_access` method to verify that client users can only see applications they're associated with and cannot see applications they're not associated with.

### 3. Enhanced API Error Handling Tests

In the file `/workspace/backenddjango/tests/integration/test_api_connections.py`, we enhanced the API error handling tests:

- **Problem**: The test didn't comprehensively test error scenarios.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `test_api_error_handling` method to test more error scenarios, including:
  - Validation errors when updating an application with invalid data
  - Forbidden access when a client tries to access an application they're not associated with

### 4. Enhanced Cross-Service Communication Tests

In the file `/workspace/backenddjango/tests/integration/test_api_connections.py`, we enhanced the cross-service communication tests:

- **Problem**: The test didn't comprehensively verify interactions between different services.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `test_cross_service_communication` method to:
  - Verify that an application is created with a borrower
  - Verify that a note is created and associated with an application
  - Test adding a fee and verifying it's correctly associated with an application
  - Test ledger entries to verify they're correctly associated with an application

## Testing

We were unable to run the tests directly due to environment issues, but we've fixed the known issues in the code. The changes we've made should resolve the issues mentioned in the request.

To verify the fixes, you should run the tests using the following commands:

```bash
# For backend tests
cd backenddjango
python manage.py test tests.integration

# For frontend tests
cd frontendVUE
npm run test
```

These commands will run the tests and verify that our fixes have resolved the issues.
