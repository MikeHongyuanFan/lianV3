# Phase 5 Implementation: WebSockets for Real-time Notifications

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of WebSockets for real-time notifications in the CRM Loan Management System. This feature is part of Phase 5 (Notifications & Background Jobs) and enhances the user experience by providing instant notification updates without requiring page refreshes.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Django Channels Setup
- Added Django Channels to the project dependencies
- Configured ASGI application in `settings.py`
- Set up Redis as the channel layer backend

### 2. WebSocket Consumer
Created a WebSocket consumer in `users/consumers.py` that:
- Authenticates users via JWT token
- Creates a user-specific notification group
- Handles WebSocket connections, disconnections, and messages
- Provides real-time notification updates and unread counts

### 3. Notification Service Enhancement
Enhanced the notification service in `users/services.py` to:
- Create notifications in the database
- Send real-time notifications via WebSockets
- Update unread notification counts in real-time

### 4. API Endpoint Updates
Updated notification API endpoints in `users/views.py` to:
- Send WebSocket updates when notifications are marked as read
- Send WebSocket updates when all notifications are marked as read

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. WebSocket Service
Created a WebSocket service in `services/websocket.js` that:
- Manages WebSocket connections
- Handles reconnection logic
- Provides a pub/sub pattern for WebSocket messages
- Authenticates WebSocket connections with JWT

### 2. Notification Center Updates
Updated `NotificationCenter.vue` to:
- Connect to WebSockets for real-time updates
- Update notification list when new notifications arrive
- Update unread count in real-time
- Remove periodic polling in favor of WebSockets

### 3. Notifications View Updates
Updated `NotificationsView.vue` to:
- Connect to WebSockets for real-time updates
- Add new notifications to the list in real-time
- Update pagination counts when new notifications arrive

### 4. Application Initialization
Updated `main.js` to:
- Connect to WebSockets when the user is authenticated
- Reconnect to WebSockets when the route changes if needed

## Testing
- Verified real-time notification delivery when application status changes
- Verified real-time notification delivery for repayment reminders
- Verified real-time unread count updates when notifications are marked as read
- Verified WebSocket reconnection logic works when connection is lost

## Next Steps
- Implement notification preferences settings
- Add email notification settings
- Start work on Phase 6 (Reporting & Metrics)
