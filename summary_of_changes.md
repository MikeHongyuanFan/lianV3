# Summary of Changes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Inconsistent API URL Configuration

- **Problem**: The frontend was using inconsistent environment variables for API URLs (`VITE_API_URL` in some places and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in others).
- **Solution**: Updated all references to use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` consistently throughout the codebase.

Changes made in `/workspace/frontendVUE/src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
// Changed from:
baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000',

// To:
baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000',
```

### 2. Incorrect API URL Format in Environment File

- **Problem**: The `.env` file had an incorrect URL format with `/api` suffix, which would cause double `/api` in paths.
- **Solution**: Updated the environment variable to use the correct base URL without the `/api` suffix.

Changes made in `/workspace/frontendVUE/.env`:
```
// Changed from:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

// To:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Incorrect API Response Handling

- **Problem**: The auth store was not correctly accessing the API response data (using `response.access` instead of `response.data.access`).
- **Solution**: Updated the auth store to correctly access the response data.

Changes made in `/workspace/frontendVUE/src/store/auth.js`:
```javascript
// Changed from:
token.value = response.access
refreshToken.value = response.refresh

// To:
token.value = response.data.access
refreshToken.value = response.data.refresh
```

### 4. Missing Token Management Function

- **Problem**: The auth store was missing the `setTokens` function that was referenced in the API service.
- **Solution**: Added the missing function to the auth store.

Added to `/workspace/frontendVUE/src/store/auth.js`:
```javascript
function setTokens(accessToken, refreshTokenValue) {
  token.value = accessToken
  if (refreshTokenValue) {
    refreshToken.value = refreshTokenValue
    localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', refreshToken.value)
  }
  localStorage.setItem('token', token.value)
}
```

### 5. Added Comprehensive API Connection Tests

- **Problem**: There were no specific tests for API connections between frontend and backend.
- **Solution**: Created new test files to verify API connections.

New test files created:
- `/workspace/frontendVUE/src/services/__tests__/api_connection.test.js`
- `/workspace/frontendVUE/src/services/__tests__/backend_connection.test.js`

These tests verify:
- Correct base URL configuration
- Proper authentication token handling
- Correct endpoint paths for various API calls
- Proper response handling

## Testing

We were unable to run the tests directly due to environment issues, but we've fixed the known issues in the code. The changes we've made should resolve the API connection issues between the frontend and backend.

To verify the fixes, you should run the tests using the following commands:

```bash
# For frontend tests
cd frontendVUE
npm run test
```

These commands will run the tests and verify that our fixes have resolved the issues.
