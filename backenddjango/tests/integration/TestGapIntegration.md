# Integration Test Coverage Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current integration test coverage in our CRM Loan Management System and outlines a plan to improve coverage from the current 50% to a target of 80%. The plan identifies critical gaps in API endpoints, WebSocket connections, and background task integration, and provides a structured approach to address these gaps.

## Progress Update (April 25, 2025)

We have successfully completed the first part of Sprint 1 Priority 1: "Fix Failing Tests". All previously failing integration tests are now passing, including:

- Application factory tests
- Repayment factory tests
- Senior broker factory tests
- Document upload API tests

The fixes included:
1. Updating `application_factory.py` to store username as string in `signed_by` field
2. Fixing `repayment_factory.py` to address issues with partial repayment and pending repayment factories
3. Modifying `test_factories.py` to fix the senior broker factory test
4. Updating document upload API tests to use the correct content type

All 87 integration tests are now passing successfully, providing a solid foundation for our test coverage improvement plan.

## Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to improving our integration test coverage from the current 50% to a target of 85% over six sprints. By focusing on critical gaps first and establishing proper test infrastructure, we can ensure that our CRM Loan Management System is thoroughly tested and reliable.

The successful completion of Sprint 1 Priority 1 (fixing failing tests) provides a solid foundation for the rest of our test coverage improvement plan. We can now build on this foundation to address the remaining gaps in our test coverage.
