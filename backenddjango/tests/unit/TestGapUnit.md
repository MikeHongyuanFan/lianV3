# Unit Test Coverage Gap Analysis (Updated)

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current unit test coverage in our CRM Loan Management System as of **April 26, 2025**, and outlines a detailed, milestone-driven plan to improve it.

Progress shows:
- Overall coverage improved from **45%** to **70%**.
- Major components like models, serializers, filters are now almost fully tested.
- Critical gaps still exist in services, views, validators, and WebSocket consumers.

New goal: **Reach 85%+ reliable coverage** by the end of Sprint 6, ensuring all critical paths are tested.

## Updated Sprint-Based Implementation Plan

### 📅 Sprint 3 (Week 5-6): Critical Recovery

| Milestone | Description | Deadline |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Fix 31 failing tests | Debug and fix all unit test failures | Week 5, Day 3 |
| 2. Cover missing critical services | Write unit tests for `applications/services.py`, `users/services.py` | Week 5, Day 5 |
| 3. Validate WebSocket functionality | Create tests for WebSocket connect, disconnect, receive | Week 5, Day 7 |
| 4. Write missing validator tests | `validate_abn`, `validate_acn` functions | Week 5, Day 10 |
| 5. Re-run full unit suite | Confirm no regressions, 75% coverage minimum | Week 6, Day 2 |

**Sprint 3 Target:** Reach 75%+ coverage and 0 failed tests by end of Week 6.

### 📅 Sprint 4 (Week 7-8): Coverage Boost

| Milestone | Description | Deadline |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Add failure and exception path tests | Cover invalid inputs, permission errors | Week 7, Day 3 |
| 2. Improve views testing | `applications/views.py`, `brokers/views.py` to 75%+ | Week 7, Day 5 |
| 3. Expand WebSocket scenario tests | Multiple user sessions, message tests | Week 8, Day 3 |
| 4. Improve document generation tests | Cover `documents/services.py` fully | Week 8, Day 5 |
