# CRM Loan Management System

A comprehensive CRM system for loan applications with fully synchronized frontend and backend development.

## Project Structure

- **Backend:** Django + Django REST Framework
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + Pinia (state), Axios (API)

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Django 4.x
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Celery + Redis (background tasks)
- SimpleJWT (auth)
- Swagger (API docs)
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Frontend
- Vue 3 + Composition API
- Vue Router
- Pinia (store)
- Axios
- TailwindCSS
- Vite

## Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

Run the entire stack with Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- Django backend on port 8000
- Vue frontend on port 3000
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Redis on port 6379
- Celery worker for background tasks

### Access the applications:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/
- Admin interface: http://localhost:8000/admin/
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/swagger/

## Manual Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backenddjango
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontendVUE
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated and available at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/swagger/
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc/

## API Relationships

The API relationships between the frontend and backend are documented in [APIRelationship.md](APIRelationship.md). This document outlines:

- Authentication flow between frontend and backend
- Application management API endpoints and their frontend counterparts
- Borrower, broker, and document management API connections
- Real-time notification system using WebSockets
- Data validation and security measures
