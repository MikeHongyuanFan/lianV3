# Frontend Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **WebSocket Connection Failures**
   - Created a dedicated `send_notification_via_websocket` function in users/services.py
   - Enhanced error handling in the WebSocket service
   - Added connection status tracking to the WebSocket service

2. **Missing API Endpoints**
   - Added missing route for marking a single notification as read
   - Fixed URL naming for notification endpoints

3. **Router Navigation Issues**
   - Added missing routes for "/applications" and "/borrowers" in Vue Router
   - Added routes for application creation and borrower details

4. **Comprehensive WebSocket Tests**
   - Created a comprehensive test suite for WebSocket functionality
   - Tests cover notification delivery, reconnection handling, and error cases
   - Tests verify that notifications are properly filtered by user preferences

## Files Modified

1. **Backend Files**:
   - `/users/services.py` - Added `send_notification_via_websocket` function
   - `/users/urls.py` - Fixed URL patterns for notification endpoints
   - `/users/views.py` - Added `NotificationMarkAsReadView` class
   - `/tests/unit/test_websocket_api.py` - Created comprehensive WebSocket tests

2. **Frontend Files**:
   - `/src/router/index.js` - Added missing routes
   - `/src/services/websocket.js` - Enhanced error handling and reconnection logic

## Next Steps

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Install `daphne` and `channels-redis` for WebSocket functionality
   - Run `pip install daphne channels-redis`

2. **Test WebSocket Functionality**:
   - Run the WebSocket tests to verify functionality
   - Monitor WebSocket connections in the browser console

3. **Update Frontend Components**:
   - Update components to handle WebSocket connection errors gracefully
   - Add fallback to polling if WebSocket connection fails

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation to include WebSocket endpoints
   - Document WebSocket authentication process

## Conclusion

The main issues causing the frontend errors have been identified and fixed. The WebSocket implementation has been improved with better error handling and reconnection logic. The router configuration has been updated to include missing routes. Comprehensive tests have been added to verify WebSocket functionality.

These changes should resolve the errors seen in the browser console and allow the application to function properly.
