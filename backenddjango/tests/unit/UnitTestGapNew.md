## Test Execution Issues

The following issues were identified during test execution:

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- **WebSocket Tests**: All WebSocket-related tests fail due to missing `daphne` module
- **Document Service Tests**: Tests fail due to missing WeasyPrint dependencies (`libgobject-2.0-0`)

### 2. URL Configuration Issues
- Several notification-related URL patterns couldn't be found:
  - `notification-unread-count`
  - `notification-mark-all-as-read`
  - `notification-mark-as-read`

### 3. Import Errors
- Some tests fail because they can't import required modules or factories:
  - `BrokerUserFactory` missing from `tests.factories`
  - `generate_application_documents` missing from `applications.services`

## Critical Testing Gaps

The following modules have critical testing gaps that need to be addressed:

1. **WebSocket Implementation (0% coverage)**
   - `users/consumers.py`
   - `users/routing.py`
   - All WebSocket-related tests are failing

2. **Service Modules with 0% Coverage**
   - `applications/services.py`
   - `users/services.py`

3. **Validation Logic (6% coverage)**
   - `applications/validators.py`

4. **Broker Views (43% coverage)**
   - `brokers/views.py`

5. **Document Services (13% coverage)**
   - `documents/services.py`

## Implementation Plan to Achieve 100% Coverage

3. **Fix URL Configuration**
   - Update URL patterns for notification endpoints
   - Ensure URL names match test expectations

4. **Fix Import Errors**
   - Create missing factories
   - Fix import paths

#### Expected Outcome:
- All existing tests can run without dependency or configuration errors
- Current coverage baseline is established

   - Test end-to-end workflows

#### Expected Outcome:
- All modules at or near 100% coverage
- Overall coverage increased to at least 95%

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Review (Week 7)

#### Objectives:
- Achieve 100% coverage
- Ensure test quality and maintainability

#### Tasks:
1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Identify remaining uncovered lines
   - Determine if uncovered lines are reachable or represent dead code

2. **Test Quality Review**
   - Review tests for maintainability
   - Ensure tests are not brittle
   - Check for proper use of mocks and fixtures

3. **Documentation**
   - Update test documentation
   - Document testing patterns and best practices

#### Expected Outcome:
- 100% coverage of all reachable code
- High-quality, maintainable test suite
- Comprehensive test documentation

## Specific Test Improvements Needed

### WebSocket Tests
- Create tests for notification WebSocket consumer
- Test WebSocket authentication
- Test real-time notification delivery
- Test WebSocket reconnection logic

### Document Service Tests
- Create mock tests for PDF generation
- Test document versioning
- Test document metadata handling
- Test document access control

### Validation Tests
- Test application schema validation
- Test validation error handling
- Test complex validation rules

### View Tests
- Test permission handling
- Test filtering and pagination
- Test error responses
- Test edge cases (e.g., invalid IDs, malformed requests)

## Conclusion

The CRM Loan Management System currently has a good foundation of tests with 71% overall coverage. Some modules, like tasks and models, already have excellent coverage (90-100%). However, there are significant gaps in WebSocket functionality, service modules, and validation logic.

By following the phased implementation plan outlined above, we can systematically address these gaps and achieve 100% test coverage. This will ensure the system is robust, reliable, and maintainable as we continue to add new features and functionality.

The most immediate priority is to fix the test environment issues, particularly the missing dependencies for WebSocket and document generation tests. Once these are resolved, we can focus on addressing the critical gaps in coverage, followed by moderate gaps, and finally fine-tuning to achieve 100% coverage.
