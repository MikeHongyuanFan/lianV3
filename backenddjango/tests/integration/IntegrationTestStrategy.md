# Integration Test Strategy for CRM Loan Management System

## Overview

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the CRM Loan Management System. Integration testing verifies that different components of the system work together correctly. Our approach focuses on two key perspectives:

1. **Individual API Integration Testing**: Testing each API endpoint with its dependent services and data stores
2. **Cross-API Integration Testing**: Testing workflows that span multiple API endpoints and services

## Goals and Objectives

- Verify that all system components integrate correctly
- Validate end-to-end business workflows
- Ensure data integrity across the entire system
- Identify integration issues that unit tests might miss
- Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Test performance under realistic conditionsy

## Test Environment

### Environment Setup

- **Integration Test Database**: Separate PostgreSQL database for integration tests
- **Test Data**: Predefined test data sets representing various business scenarios
- **Mocked External Services**: For third-party integrations (when necessary)
- **Test JWT Tokens**: Pre-generated tokens for different user roles

### Tools and Frameworks

- **Django Test Client**: For API request simulation
- **pytest**: For test organization and execution
- **pytest-django**: For Django-specific testing features
- **Factory Boy**: For test data generation
- **Coverage.py**: For measuring test coverage

## Individual API Integration Testing

Individual API integration tests focus on testing each API endpoint with its direct dependencies, ensuring that the endpoint correctly interacts with the database, services, and other components.

### Testing Approach

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Prepare the test database with required data
   - Configure any necessary mocks for external services
   - Set up authentication tokens for the required user role

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Make API requests to the endpoint under test
   - Verify the response status code, headers, and body
   - Check database state changes when applicable

3. **Verification Phase**:
   - Validate that the response matches expected format and values
   - Verify that database changes are correct and complete
   - Check that related services were called correctly

4. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Reset the database state
   - Clear any cached data

### Test Categories

#### 1. Authentication and Authorization Tests

### Example Test Structure

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
class TestApplicationAPI:
    @pytest.fixture
    def setup_application_data(self):
        # Create test users, borrowers, etc.
        # Return data needed for tests
        
    def test_create_application(self, setup_application_data, client):
        # Authenticate as broker
        # Create application via API
        # Verify response and database state
        
    def test_update_application_status(self, setup_application_data, client):
        # Authenticate as admin
        # Update application status
        # Verify status change and notifications
        
    def test_application_document_association(self, setup_application_data, client):
        # Upload document
        # Associate with application
        # Verify association
```

## Cross-API Integration Testing

Cross-API integration tests focus on testing complete business workflows that span multiple API endpoints and services, ensuring that the system works correctly as a whole.

### Testing Approach

1. **Scenario-Based Testing**:
   - Define key business scenarios (e.g., complete loan application process)
   - Map scenarios to sequences of API calls
   - Execute the API calls in order
   - Verify the end-to-end outcome

2. **State Transition Testing**:
   - Focus on application state transitions
   - Test the complete lifecycle of entities
   - Verify that state changes trigger appropriate actions

3. **User Journey Testing**:
   - Simulate real user journeys through the system
   - Test from different user perspectives (admin, broker, client)
   - Verify that each user sees appropriate data and actions

### Key Business Workflows to Test

```

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy

1. **Factory-Based Test Data**:
   - Use Factory Boy to create test data
   - Define factories for all major models
   - Create specialized factories for specific test scenarios

2. **Fixture-Based Setup**:
   - Use pytest fixtures for test data setup
   - Create hierarchical fixtures for complex scenarios
   - Use fixture parameterization for testing variations

3. **Database Resets**:
   - Reset database between test classes
   - Use transaction rollbacks for test isolation

### Example Test Data Factory

```python
class BorrowerFactory(factory.django.DjangoModelFactory):
    class Meta:
        model = Borrower
        
    first_name = factory.Faker('first_name')
    last_name = factory.Faker('last_name')
    email = factory.Faker('email')
    phone = factory.Faker('phone_number')
    residential_address = factory.Faker('address')
    
    @factory.post_generation
    def applications(self, create, extracted, **kwargs):
        if not create:
            return
            
        if extracted:
            for application in extracted:
                self.borrower_applications.add(application)
```

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Error Scenarios to Test

1. **Invalid Input Handling**:
   - Test with missing required fields
   - Test with invalid data formats
   - Test with boundary values

2. **Concurrency Issues**:
   - Test simultaneous updates to the same resource
   - Test race conditions in status transitions

3. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Test with large file uploads
   - Test with high volume of records

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Test with simulated network delays
   - Test reconnection scenarios for WebSockets

5. **Authorization Edge Cases**:
   - Test with expired tokens
   - Test with insufficient permissions
   - Test with deleted user accounts

## Performance Considerations

While detailed performance testing is outside the scope of basic integration testing, some performance aspects should be considered:

1. **Response Time Validation**:
   - Set reasonable expectations for API response times
   - Flag tests that exceed these thresholds

2. **Database Query Optimization**:
   - Monitor query counts during tests
   - Identify and flag N+1 query issues

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Test with realistic batch sizes for bulk operations
   - Verify system behavior under moderate load

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline Integration

1. **Automated Test Execution**:
   - Run integration tests on every pull request
   - Run full suite on main branch merges

2. **Test Reporting**:
   - Generate detailed test reports
   - Track test coverage over time

3. **Test Environment Management**:
   - Automatically provision test environments
   - Clean up after test execution

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**:
   - Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
   - Use fixtures for shared setup but ensure isolation

2. **Clear Test Names**:
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
   - Follow a consistent naming convention

3. **Assertion Messages**:
   - Include clear assertion messages
   - Provide context for failures

4. **Clean Setup and Teardown**:
   - Properly initialize test data
   - Clean up resources after tests

5. **Avoid Test Duplication**:
   - Don't duplicate unit test coverage
   - Focus on integration points and workflows

6. **Realistic Data**:
   - Use realistic test data that represents production scenarios
   - Test with various data volumes

7. **Mocking External Services**:
   - Mock external dependencies when necessary
   - Document all mocked services
