Perfect ‚Äì you want the **_structural design and strategic plan_** only, not the code itself.  
Got it boss. üß† Let's build it precisely:

---

# üõ†Ô∏è **Integration Testing Strategy for Full API System (No Code, Just Structure)**

---

## üéØ Overall Goal

- **Test all APIs** at the endpoint layer.
- **Capture actual system behavior**, not internal implementation.
- **Ensure services, serializers, tasks, and models are tested indirectly** through real usage.
- **Automate** via a single test suite (good for local runs, Amazon Q Chat automation, GitHub Actions).

---

## üìö Folder and File Structure

| Folder/File | Purpose |
|:------------|:--------|
| `tests/integration/` | Main folder for API integration tests |
| `tests/integration/common.py` | Shared helpers (e.g., login, setup data) |
| `tests/integration/test_auth_api.py` | Authentication-related tests |
| `tests/integration/test_users_api.py` | User CRUD, profile, login, permissions |
| `tests/integration/test_applications_api.py` | Application CRUD, update stage, related borrowers, fees |
| `tests/integration/test_borrowers_api.py` | Borrowers, guarantors APIs |
| `tests/integration/test_documents_api.py` | Documents, notes, fees, repayments APIs |
| `tests/integration/test_brokers_api.py` | Brokers, branches, BDM APIs |
| `tests/integration/test_reports_api.py` | Reporting endpoints |
| `tests/integration/test_websocket_api.py` | WebSocket connection tests |

---

## üß† Testing Scope for Each API File

Each file should include **at least these types of tests**:

| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Success Path | Normal request ‚Üí correct response (e.g., create, list, retrieve) |
| Validation Errors | Bad input ‚Üí 400 Bad Request |
| Permission Errors | No token / wrong user ‚Üí 403 Forbidden |
| Not Found | Nonexistent object ‚Üí 404 Not Found |
| Edge Cases | Large payloads, empty payloads, weird conditions |
| Authentication Expiry | Expired tokens should fail gracefully |

---

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Testing Strategy

| Phase | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| 1. **Setup** | Bootstrap database with test data; login users and get tokens |
| 2. **Action** | Send HTTP requests to actual endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) |
| 3. **Assertion** | Check HTTP status code + basic response data validation |
| 4. **Rollback** | Cleanup created data if needed (fixtures / database transaction rollbacks) |

---

## üöÄ Test Execution Strategy

| Execution Phase | Tool/Command | Description |
|:----------------|:-------------|:------------|
| Coverage Run | `coverage run -m pytest tests/integration/` | Track which lines are tested |
| Coverage Report | `coverage report` | Show in console |
| Coverage HTML | `coverage html` | View nice clickable coverage summary |
| Failure Capture | Store output of failed tests automatically into logs |
| Alerting | (Optional) Q Chat or CI tool notify if coverage drops below threshold (e.g., <75%) |

---

## üìä Metrics to Track

| Metric | Reason |
|:-------|:-------|
| Test success rate | Should be >95% (few acceptable edge case failures) |
| Coverage % | Should climb from 70% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 85% |
| API Endpoint coverage | 100% of production APIs must be hit by a test |
| Time to Run | Should stay under 5‚Äì7 minutes total |

---

## üìÖ Phased Rollout Plan (Milestone Style)

| Phase | Goal | Target Week |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| Phase 1 | Test Authentication + Users APIs | Week 1 |
| Phase 2 | Test Borrowers + Brokers APIs | Week 2 |
| Phase 3 | Test Applications + Documents APIs | Week 3 |
| Phase 4 | Test Reports + WebSocket APIs | Week 4 |
| Phase 5 | Refactor common helpers, optimize tests | Week 5 |
| Phase 6 | Full Re-run, Coverage Report Finalize | Week 6 |

‚úÖ Each phase covers a small chunk = fast iteration.  
‚úÖ No huge \"big bang\" risks.  
‚úÖ Coverage will **increase gradually** but **reliably**.

# üéØ Summary of Strategy

| Point | Strategy |
|:------|:---------|
| Test Granularity | **API Layer** (not services, not models directly) |
| Focus | Full feature coverage per endpoint |
| Efficiency | Single test run, single report, integrated coverage |
| Maintainability | One test file per API domain |
| Automation-Ready | Runs easily on local or CI (Amazon Q Chat, GitHub Actions, etc.) |
| Goal | 85%+ system coverage, 0 critical gaps |

---

# üõéÔ∏è Quick Comparison: Current vs New

| Aspect | Current | New Plan |
|:-------|:--------|:---------|
| Unit Testing | Micro-level | Macro-level (API-driven) |
| Time to Test | Long | Shorter (batch) |
| Maintenance | High | Lower |
| Coverage Clarity | Complex | Straightforward |
| Developer Overhead | Heavy | Light |

---

# üöÄ Final Conclusion:

‚úÖ Your current service-by-service testing is great for **critical internal logic validation**.  
‚úÖ But **for system stability and real world behavior**:  
‚Üí **API-level integration testing is way better, faster, smarter.**

**One command**, **full system validation**, **clean reports** = professional engineering.

Based on the testing strategy document, I'll help you revise the testing approach for the CRM Loan Management System. This new strategy focuses on
API-level integration testing rather than unit testing individual components.

# Revised Testing Strategy: API-Level Integration Testing

üõ†Ô∏è Integration Testing: Solution Plan for Remaining Issues
‚úÖ Summary of Issues Identified

Area	            |Issue
WebSocket API	    ÔΩúWebSocket connection fails when using full ASGI app (middleware/token problem)
Notification API	|Notification endpoints returning 405 Method Not Allowed
üß† Root Cause Analysis
1. WebSocket Connection Issues
Incorrect WebSocket URL path (/ws/notifications/ vs ws/notifications/).

Full ASGI app fails because authentication middleware is missing or misconfigured.

JWT token passed via URL is not properly extracted or validated during WebSocket handshake.

2. Notification API Method Issues
Notification ViewSets or APIs might only allow GET, but tests were using POST, PATCH, etc.

Endpoints might have stricter permissions (authenticated only, admin only, etc.)

üöÄ Solution Plan
1. WebSocket Authentication Fix

Step	Action
1	Implement a WebSocket Authentication Middleware (e.g., JWTAuthMiddleware)
2	Ensure the middleware extracts the token from the query parameters
3	Decode and validate the JWT token during connection phase
4	Populate scope["user"] correctly with the authenticated user object
5	Update ASGI application to use this middleware around ProtocolTypeRouter or AuthMiddlewareStack
‚úÖ This will fix authentication during WebSocket handshake and allow consumers to work properly.

2. Notification API Fix

Step	Action
1	Review each Notification ViewSet (NotificationViewSet, NotificationPreferenceViewSet)
2	Confirm the allowed HTTP methods (GET, PATCH, etc.) for each endpoint
3	Adjust API tests to only use supported methods
4	Optionally, improve the ViewSets to return a 405 Method Not Allowed with proper Allow header if unsupported methods are used
‚úÖ This will fix 405 errors and align tests with the real API design.

3. Final Integration Test Stabilization

Step	Action
1	Complete missing WebSocket and Notification test cases
2	Add pytest.mark.skip(reason="Pending implementation") for endpoints still under development
3	Run full test suite: coverage run -m pytest tests/integration/
4	Generate full coverage report: coverage report and coverage html
5	Confirm target: All major API paths covered, 0 critical errors, coverage >= 85%
‚úÖ This will prepare the project for frontend handoff and release stabilization.

### Phase 5: Refactor Common Helpers, Optimize Tests (Week 5)

‚Ä¢ Document known limitations

#### Milestone 3: CI/CD Integration
‚Ä¢ Set up automated test runs in CI/CD pipeline
‚Ä¢ Configure coverage reporting
‚Ä¢ Set up alerts for coverage drops
‚Ä¢ Create dashboard for test results

### Phase 6: Full Re-run, Coverage Report Finalize (Week 6)

#### Milestone 1: Final Test Run
‚Ä¢ Run complete test suite
‚Ä¢ Generate comprehensive coverage report
‚Ä¢ Document all test results
‚Ä¢ Fix any remaining issues

#### Milestone 2: Documentation
‚Ä¢ Update testing documentation
‚Ä¢ Document testing strategy and approach
‚Ä¢ Create developer guide for adding new tests
‚Ä¢ Document coverage metrics and goals

#### Milestone 3: Release Preparation

## Benefits of the New Strategy

1. Efficiency: Single test run provides comprehensive coverage
2. Maintainability: One test file per API domain makes maintenance easier
3. Realistic Testing: Tests actual user flows rather than isolated components
4. Better Coverage: Indirectly tests multiple components through API calls
5. Faster Execution: Fewer test files and more efficient test structure
6. Easier Debugging: API-level failures are closer to real user issues

## Implementation Approach

For each API endpoint, we'll create tests that cover:
1. Success paths (normal request ‚Üí correct response)
2. Validation errors (bad input ‚Üí 400 Bad Request)
3. Permission errors (no token / wrong user ‚Üí 403 Forbidden)
4. Not found errors (nonexistent object ‚Üí 404 Not Found)
5. Edge cases (large payloads, empty payloads, weird conditions)
6. Authentication issues (expired tokens, invalid tokens)

This approach will ensure comprehensive coverage of the system's behavior from an end-user perspective while indirectly testing the underlying 
components.
