# Unit Test Gap Analysis

This document identifies gaps in the unit test coverage for the CRM Loan Management System's API services.

## Overview

The current unit test suite includes tests for:
- Application API (`test_application_api.py`)
- User API (`test_user_api.py`)
- WebSocket API (`test_websocket_api.py`)

However, several API services lack dedicated unit tests.

## Missing Unit Tests

### 1. Borrowers API

The `borrowers/views.py` file contains several API endpoints that lack unit tests:

- `BorrowerViewSet` - Missing tests for:
  - CRUD operations (create, retrieve, update, delete)
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality
  - `applications` action
  - `guarantors` action

- `GuarantorViewSet` - No tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality

- `CompanyBorrowerListView` - No tests for:
  - Listing company borrowers

- `BorrowerFinancialSummaryView` - No tests for:
  - Financial summary retrieval

### 2. Brokers API

The `brokers/views.py` file contains several API endpoints that lack unit tests:

- `BranchViewSet` - Missing tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - `brokers` action
  - `bdms` action

- `BrokerViewSet` - Missing tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality
  - `applications` action
  - `stats` action

- `BDMViewSet` - No tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality
  - `applications` action

### 3. Documents API

The `documents/views.py` file contains several API endpoints that lack unit tests:

- `DocumentViewSet` - Missing tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality
  - `download` action

- `NoteViewSet` - No tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality

- `FeeViewSet` - No tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality

- `RepaymentViewSet` - No tests for:
  - CRUD operations
  - Role-based access control
  - Filtering and search functionality

- `DocumentCreateVersionView` - No tests for:
  - Creating new document versions

- `FeeMarkPaidView` - No tests for:
  - Marking fees as paid

- `RepaymentMarkPaidView` - No tests for:
  - Marking repayments as paid

- `ApplicationLedgerView` - No tests for:
  - Getting ledger entries for an application

### 4. Reports API

The `reports/views.py` file contains several API endpoints that lack unit tests:

- `RepaymentComplianceReportView` - Missing tests for:
  - Report generation
  - Filtering functionality
  - Data accuracy

- `ApplicationVolumeReportView` - Missing tests for:
  - Report generation
  - Filtering functionality
  - Time grouping options
  - Data accuracy

- `ApplicationStatusReportView` - Missing tests for:
  - Report generation
  - Filtering functionality
  - Conversion rate calculations
  - Data accuracy

### 5. Additional Application API Tests

While `test_application_api.py` exists, it's missing tests for:

- `validate_schema` action
- `signature` action
- Error handling for invalid data in various endpoints
- Pagination functionality
- Search functionality

### 6. Additional User API Tests

While `test_user_api.py` exists, it's missing tests for:

- `NotificationPreferenceView` - No tests for getting or updating notification preferences
- `UserViewSet.me` action - No tests for retrieving current user information

### 7. Model-Specific Tests

Missing unit tests for model-specific functionality:

- Ledger model - No tests for transaction date handling (which was fixed in a previous update)
- Repayment model - No tests for the save method that properly detects field changes (which was fixed in a previous update)

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Critical Functionality**: Start by writing tests for the most critical functionality, such as:
   - Financial operations (fees, repayments, ledger)
   - Document management
   - Report generation

2. **Test Role-Based Access Control**: Ensure all API endpoints properly enforce role-based access control.

3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add tests for edge cases and error handling, especially for financial operations.

4. **Test Model Methods**: Add unit tests for model methods, particularly those that were recently fixed.

5. **Test WebSocket Integration**: Expand WebSocket tests to cover real-time notification delivery for various events.

6. **Test Report Accuracy**: Verify that report calculations are accurate and consistent.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create test files for each missing area:
   - `test_borrower_api.py`
   - `test_broker_api.py`
   - `test_document_api.py`
   - `test_fee_api.py`
   - `test_repayment_api.py`
   - `test_report_api.py`
   - `test_ledger_model.py`
   - `test_repayment_model.py`

2. Follow the existing test structure for consistency.

3. Use the `APIClient` class for testing API endpoints.

4. Create appropriate test fixtures for each test case.

5. Implement tests for both positive scenarios and error cases.
