# API Connection Issues Report

This document outlines potential issues with API connections between frontend and backend components based on code analysis and testing of the integration tests.

## Authentication Flow Issues

1. **URL Name Mismatch**: 
   - Test uses `reverse('token_obtain_pair')` but the URL pattern in `users/urls.py` is named `'login'`
   - **Impact**: Authentication tests fail because they can't find the correct endpoint
   - **Solution**: Updated the test to use `reverse('login')` instead of `reverse('token_obtain_pair')`

2. **JWT Token Configuration**:
   - The test assumes JWT authentication is properly configured
   - **Potential issue**: JWT settings might not be correctly configured in `settings.py`
   - **Solution**: Verify JWT settings in Django settings, particularly:
     ```python
     REST_FRAMEWORK = {
         'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
             'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
         ),
     }
     
     SIMPLE_JWT = {
         'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=60),
         'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
         # Other settings...
     }
     ```

## Notification Endpoint Issues

1. **Hardcoded URL Paths**:
   - Test uses hardcoded URL `/api/users/notifications/{notification.id}/read/` which doesn't match any defined URL pattern
   - The closest match in `users/urls.py` is `notifications/mark-read/` which doesn't take an ID parameter
   - **Impact**: Tests fail because they're trying to access endpoints that don't exist
   - **Solution**: Updated the test to use the correct URL pattern with `reverse('notification-mark-read')` and pass notification IDs in the request body

2. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - The test only verifies that notification endpoints exist but doesn't test actual WebSocket connections
   - **Potential issue**: WebSocket configuration might be incorrect or missing
   - **Solution**: 
     - Implement proper WebSocket testing using channels test client
     - Add the following test code:
     ```python
     from channels.testing import WebsocketCommunicator
     from crm_backend.asgi import application
     
     @pytest.mark.asyncio
     async def test_websocket_connection():
         communicator = WebsocketCommunicator(application, f"/ws/notifications/{user_id}/")
         connected, _ = await communicator.connect()
         assert connected
         await communicator.disconnect()
     ```

## Role-Based Access Control Issues

1. **Client Access Expectations**:
   - Test expects clients to have access to applications they're associated with
   - **Potential issue**: The permission logic might not correctly filter applications for client users
   - **Solution**: 
     - Verify permission classes and queryset filtering for client users
     - Ensure the `get_queryset` method in `ApplicationViewSet` filters applications for client users:
     ```python
     def get_queryset(self):
         queryset = Application.objects.all()
         if self.request.user.role == 'client':
             # Filter to only show applications associated with this client
             borrower = Borrower.objects.filter(user=self.request.user).first()
             if borrower:
                 return queryset.filter(borrowers=borrower)
             return Application.objects.none()
         return queryset
     ```

## API Gateway Connection Issues

1. **Cross-Service Communication**:
   - The test didn't explicitly verify connections between different API gateways or microservices
   - **Impact**: Integration issues between services might not be detected
   - **Solution**: Added a new test method `test_cross_service_communication` that:
     - Tests application creation with borrower (crosses application and borrower services)
     - Tests document upload (crosses application and document services)
     - Tests adding notes (crosses application and document services)
     - Tests user notification when application stage changes (crosses application and user notification services)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Limited testing of error scenarios and edge cases
   - **Impact**: API might not handle errors gracefully in production
   - **Solution**: Added a new test method `test_api_error_handling` that tests:
     - 404 errors for non-existent resources
     - 400 errors for invalid data
     - 401 errors for unauthorized access
     - 403 errors for forbidden access (when applicable)

## Data Consistency Issues

1. **Application Creation**:
   - Test creates an application with borrowers but doesn't verify if the relationship is correctly established
   - **Potential issue**: Data relationships might not be properly maintained across API calls
   - **Solution**: 
     - Add verification steps to ensure data consistency
     - After creating an application with borrowers, fetch the application and verify the borrowers are correctly associated:
     ```python
     # Create application with borrowers
     response = self.api_client.post(applications_url, new_application_data, format='json')
     application_id = response.data['id']
     
     # Verify borrowers are correctly associated
     application_detail_url = reverse('application-detail', args=[application_id])
     response = self.api_client.get(application_detail_url)
     self.assertEqual(len(response.data['borrowers']), 1)
     self.assertEqual(response.data['borrowers'][0]['first_name'], 'Jane')
     ```

## Performance Issues

1. **Lack of Performance Testing**:
   - No tests for API response times or handling of large datasets
   - **Potential issue**: API might become slow under load
   - **Solution**: 
     - Add performance testing using tools like locust or django-silk
     - Monitor response times for key endpoints
     - Test with realistic data volumes

## Implementation Status

The following issues have been addressed in the updated test file:

- ✅ Fixed URL name mismatch in authentication flow
- ✅ Updated notification endpoint tests to use reverse() instead of hardcoded URLs
- ✅ Added cross-service communication tests
- ✅ Added API error handling tests
- ❌ WebSocket connection testing (requires additional setup)
- ❌ Performance testing (requires additional tools)

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. Implement proper WebSocket connection testing using channels test client
2. Add performance testing for critical API endpoints
3. Enhance data consistency verification across all tests
4. Add more comprehensive error scenario testing
5. Implement load testing to verify API behavior under high traffic
6. Add monitoring for API gateway connections in production
