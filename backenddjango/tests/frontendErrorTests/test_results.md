# Test Results

## WebSocket API Test Results

The test is failing due to missing dependencies:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'daphne'
```

### Required Dependencies

To run the WebSocket tests, the following dependencies need to be installed:

1. `daphne` - ASGI server for Django Channels
2. `channels` - WebSocket support for Django

### Installation Instructions

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install daphne channels channels-redis
```

### Test Modifications

If you're unable to install the dependencies, you can modify the test to skip the parts that require `daphne`:

1. Remove the import for `WebsocketCommunicator`
2. Remove the `AsyncWebSocketTest` class or mark all its tests with `@unittest.skip`
3. Keep the regular tests that use mocking instead of actual WebSocket connections

### Next Steps

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Run the tests again
3. Fix any remaining issues
4. Update the frontend to handle WebSocket errors gracefully
