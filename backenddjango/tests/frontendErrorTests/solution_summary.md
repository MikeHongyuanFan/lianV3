# Frontend Error Solution Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Vue Router Routes**
   - Added missing routes for "/applications" and "/borrowers" in Vue Router configuration
   - Created corresponding Vue component files:
     - ApplicationsView.vue - List of all loan applications
     - BorrowersView.vue - List of all borrowers
     - ApplicationFormView.vue - Form for creating new applications
     - BorrowerDetailView.vue - Detail view for a borrower
     - BorrowerFormView.vue - Form for creating/editing borrowers

2. **WebSocket Service Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in the WebSocket service
   - Added connection status tracking to prevent crashes
   - Added try/catch blocks around WebSocket operations
   - Added a getConnectionStatus method to check connection state

3. **API Endpoint Fixes**
   - Added missing route for marking a single notification as read
   - Fixed URL naming for notification endpoints
   - Created a dedicated send_notification_via_websocket function

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Frontend Vue Components**:
   - `/src/views/ApplicationsView.vue` - List view for applications
   - `/src/views/BorrowersView.vue` - List view for borrowers
   - `/src/views/ApplicationFormView.vue` - Form for creating applications
   - `/src/views/BorrowerDetailView.vue` - Detail view for borrowers
   - `/src/views/BorrowerFormView.vue` - Form for creating/editing borrowers

2. **Router Configuration**:
   - Updated `/src/router/index.js` with missing routes

3. **WebSocket Service**:
   - Enhanced `/src/services/websocket.js` with better error handling

4. **Backend Services**:
   - Added `send_notification_via_websocket` function to `/users/services.py`
   - Updated notification views to use the new function
   - Added comprehensive WebSocket tests

## Testing

Created comprehensive WebSocket tests in `test_websocket_api.py` that test:

1. Notification creation and delivery
2. WebSocket message sending
3. Notification preferences filtering
4. Error handling and reconnection
5. Multiple user notification delivery
6. Application event notifications

## Next Steps

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install daphne channels-redis
   ```

2. **Run the WebSocket Tests**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test tests.unit.test_websocket_api
   ```

3. **Update Frontend Components**:
   - Add fallback to polling if WebSocket connection fails
   - Add visual indicators for WebSocket connection status

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation to include WebSocket endpoints
   - Document WebSocket authentication process

## Conclusion

The frontend errors were primarily caused by missing routes and components in the Vue Router configuration, as well as issues with the WebSocket implementation. By adding the missing routes and components, and enhancing the WebSocket service with better error handling, we've resolved the issues that were preventing the application from functioning properly.

The application should now be able to navigate to the applications and borrowers pages, and handle WebSocket connection errors gracefully.
